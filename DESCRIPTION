Title: Tools for computing and validating composite indicators across multiple years

Description: The package contains functions that create composite indicators for multiple years returning scores and ranks for each statistical unit. It contains a function that eases the preprocessing stage by rescaling columns using min-max normalization, z-scoring, or ranking. 
    The functions compute scores and ranks for inclusion/exclusion of basic variables as part of the uncertainity analysis.
    To display uncertainity analysis, the package offers functions that (1) count the number (percent) of times a statistical unit takes a given rank; (2) provide a table with the initial rank, average and median rank taken accross simulations;
    (3) export .xlsx tables with the frequencies of each rank color coded for initial, median and modal rank; (4) compute the average shift in ranking (total, per year, and per country and year);
    (5) create boxplots of ranks taken in different simulations (and stores them in .png files).
